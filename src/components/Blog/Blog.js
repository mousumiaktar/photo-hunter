                                In authentication process, the identity of users are checked for providing the access to the system.

                                In authentication process, users or persons are verified

                <h3>2. Why are you using firebase? What other options do you have to implement authentication?</h3>
                <p>I'm using Firebase Authentication to allow users to sign in to my app using one or more sign-in methods, including email address and password sign-in, and federated identity providers such as Google Sign-in and Facebook Login.Firebase Authentication makes it easier to get our users signed-in without having to understand the complexities behind implementing your own authentication system.Usually, authentication by a server entails the use of a user name and password. Other ways to authenticate can be through cards, retina scans, voice recognition, and fingerprints.</p>
